# Express-Mongo

A simple sample CRUD application to test using Keploy build with Express and MongoDB.

## Setup application
Clone the repository and move to express-mongo folder
```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript && cd samples-typescript/express-mongo

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

# Using Keploy :

There are two ways to use Keploy:-

1. [Natively on Linux/WSL](#natively-on-ubuntuwsl)
2. [Using Docker](#running-sample-app-using-docker)

## Natively on Ubuntu/WSL

Keploy can be installed on Linux directly and on Windows with the help of WSL. Based on your system architecture, install the keploy latest binary release from here:-

#### Linux
1. AMD Architecture
```zsh
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_linux_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && sudo mv /tmp/keploy /usr/local/bin && keploy
```

<details>
<Summary> 2. ARM Architecture </Summary>


```zsh
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_linux_arm64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && sudo mv /tmp/keploy /usr/local/bin && keploy
```
</details>

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

On Windows, WSL is required to run Keploy Binary. You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11 to use the commands below.

```bash
wsl --install
```
Once installed download and Install "Keploy Binary" :

```bash
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_linux_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && sudo mv /tmp/keploy /usr/local/bin && keploy
```

### Let's start the MongoDB Instance
```zsh
docker-compose up -d
```

> **Since we have setup our sample-app natively, we need to update the mongoDB host on line 41, in `db/connection.js`, from `mongodb://mongoDb:27017/Students` to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/keploy`.**

### Capture the testcases

```bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH keploy record -c 'node src/app.js'
```

#### Let's generate the testcases.
Make API Calls using [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io), [Postman](https://postman.com) or cURL command. Keploy with capture those calls to generate the test-suites containing testcases and data mocks.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url http://localhost:8000/students \
   --header 'content-type: application/json' \
   --data '{
    "name":"John Do",
    "email":"john@xyiz.com",
    "phone":"0123456799"
    }'
```

we will get the output:

```
Student registration successful!
```

We will get the following output in our terminal

![Testcase](./img/testcase-node.png)

## Running the testcases

```bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH keploy test -c 'npm run src/app.js' --delay 10
```

Our testcases will fail as the Keep-Alive connection won't be available when we are using testmode, this happen because in test mode the Keploy uses the `Mocks.yml`, which was generated in the record mode.

![Testcase](./img/testrun-node-fail.png)

Let's add the `connection` and `keep-alive` as the noise in the test-1.yml on line 42 under `header.Date`. The file would look like:-
```
        noise:
        |   - header.Date
        |   - header.Keep-Alive
        |   - header.Connection
```

Now, let's run the keploy in test mode again:-

*Voila!! Our testcases has passed ðŸŒŸ*

# Running sample app using docker

Keploy can be used on Linux, Windows and MacOS through Docker.

Note: To run Keploy on MacOS through [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#4252) the version must be ```4.25.2``` or above.

## Create Keploy Alias
We need create an alias for Keploy:
```bash
alias keploy='sudo docker run --pull always --name keploy-v2 -p 16789:16789 --privileged --pid=host -it -v "$(pwd)":/files -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup -v /sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug -v /sys/fs/bpf:/sys/fs/bpf -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --rm ghcr.io/keploy/keploy'
```

## Capture the testcases
 
We will run the keploy in record mode with docker-compose to start our application:-
```bash
keploy record -c "docker compose up" --containerName "nodeMongoApp"
```

#### Let's generate the testcases.
Make API Calls using [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io), [Postman](https://postman.com) or cURL command. Keploy with capture those calls to generate the test-suites containing testcases and data mocks.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url http://localhost:8000/students \
   --header 'content-type: application/json' \
   --data '{
    "name":"John Doe",
    "email":"john@xyz.com",
    "phone":"0123456798"
    }'
```

we will get the output:

```
Student registration successful!
```

We will get the following output in our terminal

![Testcase](./img/testcase-node.png)


## Running the testcases

```bash
keploy test -c "docker compose up --node-app" --containerName "nodeMongoApp" --delay 10
```

Our testcases will fail as the Keep-Alive connection won't be available when we are using testmode, this happen because in test mode the Keploy uses the `Mocks.yml`, which was generated in the record mode.

![Testcase](./img/testrun-node-fail.png)

Let's add the `connection` and `keep-alive` as the noise in the test-1.yml on line 42 under `header.Date`. The file would look like:-
```
        noise:
        |   - header.Date
        |   - header.Keep-Alive
        |   - header.Connection
```

Now, let's run the keploy in test mode again:-
